    "There are two main categories of classification models:\n",
    "1. Binary classification models - there are only two possible outcomes\n",
    "2. Multiclass classification - there are more than two possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other less common categories like multilable classification models which can classify a single input as belonging to several classes. There are also some models which can predict that an input belongs to none of the possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the things that are important in regression also apply to classification models, with the main difference being the way that accuracy is measured. In classification there isn't a R-squared metric but in its place are other measured like precision, recall, specificity, sensitivity and F1 score. One of the most important things in classification is to know which accuracy metric to use based on the model's intended application."

    "Logistic Regression is an algorithm that is used only for classification. It analyzes a distribution of data and fits an equation to it that defines the porbability that a given sample belogns to each of the possible classes and it predicts that it belongs to the class which has a higher probability. Despite the name logistic regression is used for classificatin, its purpose is not to create regression models but to quantify probabilities for the purpose of classifying input samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm draws a curve that given an x shows the probability that a point with that x belongs to class 1. It charts a function known as the logistic function (also known as the logit function). The function for logistic regression is defined as:\n",

    "$ y = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(mx + b)}}$\n",

    "Where x is the input value and m and b are parameters learned during training. The reason it is called logistic regression is that the exponent of e happens to be the equation for linear regression.\n",
