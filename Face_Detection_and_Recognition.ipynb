    "One of the fastest and most popular algorithms for detecting faces in photos. The algorithm keys on the relative intensities of adjacent blocks of pixels. For example the average pixel intensity in a rectangle around the eyes is typically darker than the average pixel intensity in a rectangle immediately below that area. The presence of many such Haar-like features in a frame at the right locations is an indicator that the frame contains a face. Viola-Jones works by sliding windows of various sizes over an image looking for frames with Haar-like features in the right places. At each stop, the pixels in the window are scaled to a specified size (typically 24 x 24) and features are extracted and fed into a binary classifier that returns positive indicating the frame contains a face or negative indicating it does not."
