    "A neural network is defined by the number of layers (the depth), the number of neurons in each layer (the width of the layeres), the types of layers, and the activation functions used. When designing a network it is important that you pick the minimum width and depth which achives the accuracy required. There are a few guidelines when making this choice:\n",
    "1. Greater widths and depths give the network more capacity to \"learn\" by fitting more tightly to the training data but also increase the risk of overfitting. The simplest way to loosen the fit is to reduce the number of neurons.\n",
    "2. Generarly it is better to have greater width than greater depth to avoid the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
