    "CNNs are mostly used in the field of computer vision. CNNs treat images as images rather than just arrays of pixel values. They use convolution kernels to extract \"features\" from imagesm allowig them to recognize the shape of a cat's head or the outline of a dog's tail."

    "CNNs contain one or more sets of convolutional and pooling layers. Convolutional layers extract features from images, generating transformed images that are commonly referred to as feature maps. Pooling layers reduce the feature map's size by half so that features can be extracted at various resolutions and are less sensitive to small changes in position. The output from the final pooling layer is flattened  to one dimension and input to one or more dense layers for classification. The convolution and pooling layers are called bottleneck layers since they reduce the dimensionality of images input to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers extract features from images by passing convolution kernels over them. A kernel is simply a matrix of values. It usually measures 3 x 3, but it can be larger. To process an image, you place the kernel in the upper-left corner of the image, multiply the kernel values by the pixel values underneath, and compute a new value for the center pixel by summing the products. Then move the kernel one pixel to the right and repeat the process continuing row by row and column by column until the entire image has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolution layer doesn't use just one kernel to process images. It uses many sometimes 100 or more. The kernel values aren't determined ahead of time, they are initialized with random values and then learned (adjusted) as the CNN is trained, jsut as the weights connecting neurons in dense layers are learned. Each kernel also has a bias associated with it, just like a neuron in a dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers downsample images to reduce their size. The most common resizing technique is max pooling which divides images into 2 x 2 blocks of pixels and selects the highest of the four values in each block. An alternative is average pooling which averages the values in each block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to downsize an image is to set the stride of convolutional layers to 2 instead of using pooling layers. Stride is the number of pixels a convolution kernel moves as it passes over an image. Setting it to 2 halves the image size by ignoring every other row and every other column of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense layers at the end of the network classify features extracted from the bottleneck layers and are referred to as the CNN's classification layers, they are the same as the multilayer perceptrons. For binary classification the output layer contains one neuron that uses the sigmoid activation function. For multiclass classification the output layer contains one neuron per class and uses the soft max activation function."
